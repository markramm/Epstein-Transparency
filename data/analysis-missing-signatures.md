# Analysis: Who Hasn't Signed Yet?

## Current Status
- **Total Signatures:** 215/218
- **Republicans Signed:** 4 (Massie, Mace, Greene, Boebert)  
- **Democrats Signed:** 211 (out of 212 current Democrats)
- **Needed:** 3 more signatures

## The Missing Democrat(s)

With 212 total Democrats in the House and 211 signed, there's likely 1 Democrat who hasn't signed. Most probable:

### Most Likely Non-Signers (Democrats):
1. **Henry Cuellar (TX-28)** - Currently under federal indictment for bribery and money laundering. May be avoiding any controversial votes.

2. **Jared Golden (ME-02)** - Most conservative Democrat, represents Trump +6 district. Often breaks with party.

3. **Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03)** - Moderate in deep red district, very cautious on controversial issues.

4. **Dean Phillips (MN-03)** - Challenged Biden in primary, may be isolated from caucus.

5. **Rob Menendez (NJ-08)** - Son of indicted Senator Bob Menendez, may want to avoid anything Epstein-related.

## The 3 Republicans We Need (Top Targets)

### HIGHEST PRIORITY - The Hypocrite:
**Jeff Van Drew (NJ-02)**
- **CO-SPONSORED H.R. 185** but won't sign discharge petition
- Phone: 202-225-6572
- This is the most outrageous - he literally sponsored the bill!

### HIGHEST PRIORITY - The Oversight Chair:
**Jen Kiggans (VA-02)**  
- Chairs VA Oversight & Investigations Subcommittee
- Her literal job is oversight and accountability
- Phone: 202-225-4215
- Competitive district (won by 4 points)

### HIGH PRIORITY - The Anti-Trafficker:
**Young Kim (CA-40)**
- Anti-Human Trafficking Caucus leader
- Should care about survivor justice
- Phone: 202-225-4111
- Orange County moderate

### Other Strong Possibilities:

**Ashley Hinson (IA-02)**
- Judiciary Committee member
- Under pressure from DNC ads
- Phone: 202-225-2911

**Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01)**  
- Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair
- Most bipartisan Republican
- Phone: 202-225-4276

- Phone: 202-225-3931

**Don Bacon (NE-02)**
- Biden district Republican
- Needs moderate credibility
- Phone: 202-225-4155

## Why Republicans Haven't Signed

### Leadership Opposition:
- Speaker Mike Johnson strongly opposes
- Majority Leader Steve Scalise blocking
- Whip Tom Emmer enforcing discipline

### Political Calculations:
- Waiting to be one of final 3 (maximum leverage)
- Fear of primary challenges
- Concern about conspiracy theory association

### The Gender Pattern:
- **Women who signed:** Mace, Greene, Boebert (3/3 approached)
- **Men who signed:** Only Massie (1/200+)
- Clear gender divide on courage vs. caution

## Strategic Notes

1. **We need exactly 3 more** - This is achievable TODAY

2. **Van Drew is the key** - His hypocrisy is indefensible

3. **Moderates in competitive districts** have the most pressure

4. **The missing Democrat** doesn't matter if we get 3 Republicans

5. **Every hour counts** - Leadership is actively pressuring members NOT to sign
