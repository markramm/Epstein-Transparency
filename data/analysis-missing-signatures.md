# Analysis: Who Hasn't Signed Yet?

## Current Status (119th Congress)
- **Total House Members:** 435 (222 Republicans, 214 Democrats, with 1 vacancy)
- **Total Signatures:** 215/218
- **Republicans Signed:** 4 (Massie, Mace, Greene, Boebert)  
- **Democrats Signed:** 211 (out of 214 current Democrats)
- **Needed:** 3 more signatures

## The Missing Democrats

With 214 total Democrats and 211 signed, there are 3 Democrats who haven't signed.

**Surprisingly, these Democrats DID sign:**
- **Henry Cuellar (TX-28)** - Signed Sept 3rd despite federal indictment (#214)
- **Jared Golden (ME-02)** - Signed Sept 2nd despite being most conservative (#50)
- **Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03)** - Signed Sept 2nd despite red district (#77)
- **Robert Menendez Jr. (NJ-08)** - Signed Sept 2nd despite father's issues (#117)
- **Donald Davis (NC-01)** - Signed Sept 2nd (#129)

**The 3 Democrats who haven't signed are unknown** - we would need to cross-reference all 214 Democrats against the 211 who signed to identify them.

## The 3 Republicans We Need (Top Targets)

### HIGHEST PRIORITY - The Hypocrite:
**Jeff Van Drew (NJ-02)**
- **CO-SPONSORED H.R. 185** but won't sign discharge petition
- Phone: 202-225-6572
- This is the most outrageous - he literally sponsored the bill!

### HIGHEST PRIORITY - The Oversight Chair:
**Jen Kiggans (VA-02)**  
- Chairs VA Oversight & Investigations Subcommittee
- Her literal job is oversight and accountability
- Phone: 202-225-4215
- Competitive district (won by 4 points)

### HIGH PRIORITY - The Anti-Trafficker:
**Young Kim (CA-40)**
- Anti-Human Trafficking Caucus leader
- Should care about survivor justice
- Phone: 202-225-4111
- Orange County moderate

### Other Strong Possibilities:

**Ashley Hinson (IA-02)**
- Judiciary Committee member
- Under pressure from DNC ads
- Phone: 202-225-2911

**Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01)**  
- Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair
- Most bipartisan Republican
- Phone: 202-225-4276
- Former FBI agent

**Maria Elvira Salazar (FL-27)**
- Former journalist
- Miami district with trafficking concerns
- Phone: 202-225-3931

**Don Bacon (NE-02)**
- Biden district Republican
- Needs moderate credibility
- Phone: 202-225-4155

## Why Republicans Haven't Signed

### Leadership Opposition:
- Speaker Mike Johnson strongly opposes
- Majority Leader Steve Scalise blocking
- Whip Tom Emmer enforcing discipline

### Political Calculations:
- Waiting to be one of final 3 (maximum leverage)
- Fear of primary challenges
- Concern about conspiracy theory association

### The Gender Pattern:
- **Total GOP Women in House:** 28
- **GOP Women who signed:** Mace, Greene, Boebert (3 out of 28 GOP women = 10.7%)
- **GOP Men who signed:** Only Massie (1 out of 194 GOP men = 0.5%)
- Clear gender gap: GOP women are 20x more likely to have signed
- **Key fact:** 25 Republican women have NOT signed yet

## Strategic Notes

1. **We need exactly 3 more** - This is achievable TODAY

2. **Van Drew is the key** - His hypocrisy is indefensible

3. **Moderates in competitive districts** have the most pressure

4. **The missing Democrat** doesn't matter if we get 3 Republicans

5. **Every hour counts** - Leadership is actively pressuring members NOT to sign
