# Frequently Asked Questions: Epstein Files Discharge Petition

## About the Discharge Petition

### What is a discharge petition?
A discharge petition is a procedural tool in the U.S. House of Representatives that allows members to force a floor vote on a bill that's been stuck in committee. It requires 218 signatures (a majority of the House) to succeed.

### Why is this approach being used?
House leadership has not brought the Epstein files disclosure bill to a floor vote. The discharge petition bypasses leadership and forces a vote if enough members sign.

### Current Status (as of September 2025)
- **134 signatures** secured out of 218 needed
- **4 Republicans** have signed (Massie, Mace, Greene, Boebert)
- Need **84 more signatures** to force a vote

## About the Files

### What's been released so far?
On September 3, 2025, the House Oversight Committee released ~33,000 pages, but:
- Most were already public
- Heavily redacted
- 97% of content was either previously released or blacked out

### What files remain unreleased?
- Department of Justice investigation files
- FBI interview records
- Financial transaction records

### Why weren't perpetrators prosecuted?
Marina Lacerda stated: "Our government could have saved so many women, but Jeffrey Epstein was too important and those women didn't matter"

## The Proposed Framework

### What's in the JFK-style disclosure framework?

1. **Presumption of release** - default to transparency
2. **Narrow exemptions** only for:
   - Ongoing investigations
   - National security (with justification)
3. **Independent review board** including:
   - Security-cleared members
   - Survivor advocate seat
   - Transparency experts
4. **Automatic protections**:
   - All minor identities redacted
   - Adult survivors can opt-in to be named
   - Re-identifying details removed
5. **Public accountability**:
   - Log of any withheld documents
   - Justification required for each redaction
   - Annual review process

## Political Dynamics

### Who has shown courage?

**Republicans Who Signed Despite Party Pressure:**
- Thomas Massie (KY-04) - Filed the petition
- Nancy Mace (SC-01) - Rape survivor who left meeting in tears
- Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) - Defied leadership due to constituent calls
- Lauren Boebert (CO-04) - Risked political career

- Chairman Jim Jordan - Won't sign despite Judiciary Committee role

- Party loyalty over conscience

### "It's a partisan witch hunt"
**Reality**: Bipartisan effort led by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna. Republicans Mace, Greene, and Boebert have signed.

### "The important files were already released"
**Reality**: 97% of the September 2025 release was already public or redacted. Key DOJ and FBI files remain sealed.

### "It's just a conspiracy theory"
**Reality**: Marina Lacerda, who helped convict Epstein: "This is not a hoax."
