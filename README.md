## The Ask

Support bringing to the floor a **JFK-style disclosure framework** for remaining Epstein-related records:
- Presumption of release with narrow, time-limited exemptions
- Independent disclosure review board with survivor advocate seat
- Automatic redaction of minors' identities (opt-in for adults)
- Public Vaughn-style index for any withholdings
- Firm deadlines and searchable public repository

**Primary Legislation:**
- [H.R. 4405](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text) - JFK-style disclosure framework with victim protections
- [H.Res. 581](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581) - Discharge rule vehicle to force floor vote
