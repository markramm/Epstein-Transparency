# Epstein Files Discharge Petition Tracker

**Status: 217/218 signatures (As of Oct 17, 2025)** | [Live Dashboard](https://markramm.github.io/Epstein-Transparency) | [Verify at House Clerk](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209)

## Mission
Track progress toward 218 signatures needed to force a House vote on releasing all Epstein-related government records with proper victim protections.

## ðŸš¨ BREAKING: 1 SIGNATURE AWAYâ€”BUT DELIBERATELY BLOCKED! ðŸš¨

**The Situation:** Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva won her Arizona special election on Sept 23 and pledged to provide the 218th signature. Speaker Johnson refuses to swear her in during the government shutdownâ€”a clear break from precedent.

**The Double Standard:**
- **April 2025:** Johnson swore in 2 GOP Reps the day after their elections during pro-forma sessions
- **Sept 2025:** Johnson swore in Rep. Walkinshaw (D-VA) less than 24 hours after his election
- **Oct 2025:** Grijalva has waited 24+ days with no scheduled swearing-in

Arizona AG has threatened legal action. This is procedural obstruction to prevent the Epstein files vote.

## The Ask

Support bringing to the floor a **JFK-style disclosure framework** for remaining Epstein-related records:
- Presumption of release with narrow, time-limited exemptions
- Independent disclosure review board with survivor advocate seat
- Automatic redaction of minors' identities (opt-in for adults)
- Public Vaughn-style index for any withholdings
- Firm deadlines and searchable public repository

**Primary Legislation:**
- [H.R. 4405](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text) - JFK-style disclosure framework with victim protections
- [H.Res. 581](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581) - Discharge rule vehicle to force floor vote
