# Epstein Files Discharge Petition Tracker

**Status: 217/218 signatures (As of Oct 22, 2025)** | [Live Dashboard](https://markramm.github.io/Epstein-Transparency) | [Verify at House Clerk](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209)

## Mission
Track progress toward 218 signatures needed to force a House vote on releasing all Epstein-related government records with proper victim protections.

## ðŸš¨ BREAKING: 30+ DAYS OF OBSTRUCTION - LEGAL ACTION THREATENED ðŸš¨

**The Situation:** Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva won her Arizona special election on **Sept 23** and pledged to provide the 218th signature. Speaker Johnson refuses to swear her inâ€”now **30+ days** of unprecedented delay. Government shutdown now **third-longest in U.S. history**.

**The Double Standard:**
- **April 2025:** Johnson swore in 2 GOP Reps **1 day** after their elections during pro-forma sessions
- **Sept 2025:** Johnson swore in Rep. Walkinshaw (D-VA) **less than 24 hours** after his election
- **Oct 2025:** Grijalva has waited **30+ days** with House in recess through Oct 26

**Legal Escalation:**
- **Oct 17:** House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries threatens "swift and decisive legal action"
- **Oct 14:** Arizona AG Kris Mayes drafting lawsuit against Speaker Johnson
- **Oct 14-15:** Democrats march to Johnson's office chanting "Swear her in!"
- **Johnson's response:** Dismissed as "publicity stunt"

## ðŸ’œ Virginia Giuffre's Posthumous Memoir Released Oct 21

**"Nobody's Girl"** published during this standoff. Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent Epstein survivors, died by suicide in April 2025 at age 41. Before her death, she stated releasing her memoir was her "heartfelt wish" - "regardless" of circumstances. The timing adds profound moral weight to survivors' plea for transparency.

## The Ask

Support bringing to the floor a **JFK-style disclosure framework** for remaining Epstein-related records:
- Presumption of release with narrow, time-limited exemptions
- Independent disclosure review board with survivor advocate seat
- Automatic redaction of minors' identities (opt-in for adults)
- Public Vaughn-style index for any withholdings
- Firm deadlines and searchable public repository

**Primary Legislation:**
- [H.R. 4405](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text) - JFK-style disclosure framework with victim protections
- [H.Res. 581](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581) - Discharge rule vehicle to force floor vote
