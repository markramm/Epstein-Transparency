### How to Join Existing Pressure

1. **Find active posts** using the search links above
2. **Reply/QT with pressure:** "Still waiting for you to sign the discharge petition"
3. **Add facts:** "134/218 signatures. Survivors are watching."
4. **Tag local media:** Find your local reporters and tag them
5. **Use their own words:** Hinson said she supports "transparency" - remind her

### Sample Amplification Replies

**Under posts about Van Drew:**
```
Reminder: @CongressmanJVD literally CO-SPONSORED H.R. 185 (the transparency bill) but won't sign the discharge petition to force a vote. Why sponsor it if you won't support bringing it to the floor? #NJ02 wants answers.
```

**Under posts about Kiggans:**
```
@JenKiggans chairs Oversight & Investigations. You expelled Santos for ethics but won't investigate the biggest trafficking case in history? #VA02 wants accountability.
```

**Under posts about Hinson:**
```
The DNC had to run ads because @RepAshleyHinson opposes transparency. Even MGT says this is what constituents care about most. Iowa deserves better than "trust the administration."
```

**Generic pressure reply:**
```
[Rep handle] still hasn't signed the Epstein files discharge petition.
‚úì 134 have signed
‚úì Survivors support it
‚úì It's bipartisan
What's the holdup?
```

### Reply Templates

**To "What about victims?"**
```
The framework includes automatic redaction of minors' identities and opt-in for adults. Survivors held a press conference SUPPORTING disclosure with these protections. This is victim-centered transparency.
```

**To "We already released files"**
```
33,000 heavily redacted pages isn't transparency. We need a comprehensive framework: presumption of release, independent review board, public index of withholdings. Finish the job properly.

As business leaders and citizens, we have a responsibility to demand accountability from our institutions.

The Epstein files discharge petition needs 218 signatures to force a House vote on comprehensive disclosure. Currently at 134.

The proposed framework mirrors the successful JFK Records Act:
‚Ä¢ Presumption of release with narrow exemptions
‚Ä¢ Independent review board including survivor advocates  
‚Ä¢ Strong privacy protections for victims
‚Ä¢ Public accountability through disclosure indices

This isn't about politics‚Äîit's about preventing future crimes through transparency and accountability.
