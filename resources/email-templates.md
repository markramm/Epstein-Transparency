**Subject:** Please support discharge petition for Epstein files disclosure framework

Dear Representative [LAST NAME],

As your constituent in [CITY, ZIP], I urge you to sign the discharge petition to bring to a vote a bipartisan, victim-centered framework for completing the release of government-held Epstein records.

The proposed framework includes:
- Presumption of release with narrowly tailored, time-limited exemptions
- A small, independent disclosure review board with a survivor advocate seat
- Automatic redaction of minors' identities and re-identifying details
- Opt-in disclosure for adult survivors who choose to be named
- A public Vaughn-style index documenting any withholdings
- Firm deadlines and periodic reporting in a searchable repository

On September 3, survivors held a Capitol press conference urging full disclosure, stating "this is not a hoax." While I appreciate the recent release of 33,000 pages, much was already public or heavily redacted. We need a comprehensive, victim-safe framework to finish this properly.

This approach prioritizes survivors, strengthens institutional trust, and helps prevent future abuse. The discharge petition currently has 134 of the 218 signatures needed.

Please let me know if you will sign the discharge petition this week.

Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]

### Young Kim (CA-40)

**Subject:** Your anti-trafficking leadership needed on Epstein disclosure

Dear Representative Kim,

As your constituent and someone who admires your leadership on the Congressional Anti-Human Trafficking Caucus, I'm writing about the Epstein files discharge petition.

Your work fighting trafficking makes you uniquely positioned to understand why comprehensive disclosure—with strong victim protections—is essential for preventing future crimes. The proposed framework ensures survivor privacy while exposing the networks that enable abuse.

The Orange County Register recently endorsed transparency in this matter. Your district is watching, and your voice would be particularly powerful given your anti-trafficking expertise.

Will you sign the discharge petition to bring this victim-centered framework to a vote?

Respectfully,
[NAME, ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENT]

### Jen Kiggans (VA-02)

**Subject:** Consistency with your oversight and ethics positions

Dear Representative Kiggans,

As a Virginia Beach constituent, I appreciated your vote to expel Rep. Santos for ethics violations. That same commitment to accountability is needed now for the Epstein files discharge petition.

As Vice Chair of the Virginia Oversight Committee, you understand the importance of transparency. The proposed framework includes an independent review board and public accountability measures—exactly the kind of oversight you champion.

You won your seat by just 4 points. Voters across the political spectrum support this bipartisan effort. Will you sign the discharge petition?

Thank you,
[NAME, VA-02 RESIDENT]

### Ashley Hinson (IA-02)

**Subject:** Judiciary Committee member support needed

Dear Representative Hinson,

As your constituent and someone who values your Judiciary Committee service, I'm asking you to sign the Epstein files discharge petition.

Your committee work gives you insight into balancing transparency with legal protections. This framework does exactly that—presumption of release with narrow exemptions for active investigations, automatic victim protections, and judicial review options.

Iowa voters value straightforward accountability. This isn't partisan—it's about doing what's right. Will you add your signature?

Best regards,
[NAME, IOWA RESIDENT]

### Maria Elvira Salazar (FL-27)

**Subject:** Your journalism background makes your voice crucial

Dear Representative Salazar,

As a Miami constituent, I know you understand our community's concerns about trafficking. Your background as an investigative journalist makes you uniquely qualified to champion transparency.

The Epstein files discharge petition needs representatives who understand both the importance of disclosure and the need to protect sources and victims. The framework includes both—just like responsible journalism.

Miami has been directly affected by trafficking networks. Your signature would show real commitment to exposing and preventing these crimes.

Will you sign this week?

Sincerely,
[NAME, MIAMI RESIDENT]
