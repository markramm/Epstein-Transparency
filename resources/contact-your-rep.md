# Contact Your U.S. House Representative (Nonpartisan Guide)

## Purpose
Ask your Representative‚Äîregardless of party‚Äîto support transparency with protection: release unclassified Epstein records while automatically redacting victim PII and CSAM (as specified in [H.R. 4405 ‚Äì Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405)).

## 1) Identify and Reach Your Representative

- **Find your Rep & contact page:** [House "Find Your Representative"](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)

- **Alternative lookup:** [Congress.gov "Find Your Members"](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member)

## 2) What to Ask (Keep It Simple and Specific)

- **Publicly support** "transparency with protection"
- **Sign the active House discharge petition** to bring the bill to the floor ([see Clerk of the House](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/20251189?CongressNum=119))
- **Vote YES on H.R. 4405**

**Why this bill?** It requires DOJ (including FBI and U.S. Attorneys) to release unclassified Epstein-related records while permitting redactions for:
- Victim PII
- CSAM  
- Active investigations (temporary)
- Properly classified material
‚Äîwith written justifications for redactions.

**Key line to repeat:** "Please stand with survivors: release the truth, protect the vulnerable."
