# Phone Call Scripts

## Primary Script (60-90 seconds)

"Hi, I'm **[YOUR NAME]**, a constituent in **[ZIP CODE]**. 

I'm asking the Representative to **support bringing to the floor a JFK-style disclosure framework** for the remaining Epstein records with:
- Default to release
- A neutral review board  
- Automatic survivor privacy protections
- A public log of any withholdings

This is nonpartisan, victim-centered, and about restoring trust. Can you note my request and share the office's position?"

---

## Short Version (30 seconds voicemail)

"Hi, this is **[NAME]** in **[ZIP]**. Please support a floor vote on a victim-safe, JFK-style disclosure framework for the Epstein files—presumption of release, narrow redactions, independent review, and a public index. Thank you."

---

## If They Ask "What Framework?"

"A bipartisan approach similar to the JFK Records Act:
1. **Presumption of release** with narrow, time-limited exemptions
2. **Independent review board** with security-cleared members and a survivor advocate
3. **Automatic redaction** of minors' identities; opt-in for adult survivors
4. **Public Vaughn index** showing what's withheld and why
5. **Firm deadlines** and a searchable public repository"

---

## If They Say "We Already Released Files"

"I appreciate the recent releases. However, the 33,000 pages were heavily redacted and incomplete. We need a comprehensive framework to finish the job properly—one that protects survivors while ensuring real transparency, not selective disclosure."

---

## If They Say "This Could Harm Victims"

"That's exactly why the framework includes automatic redaction of all minors' identities and re-identifying details. Adult survivors can opt-in if they choose. The survivor community held a press conference supporting full disclosure with these protections."

---

## If They Say "Ongoing Investigations"

"The framework allows for narrow, time-limited exemptions for active investigations, reviewed by an independent board. A public index would show exactly what's withheld and why—no blanket secrecy."

---

## For Priority Targets

### Young Kim (CA-40)
Add: "As a leader on anti-trafficking issues, Representative Kim's support would show real commitment to protecting future victims through transparency."

### Jen Kiggans (VA-02)  
Add: "Given Representative Kiggans' oversight role and her vote to expel Santos for ethics violations, this is consistent with holding power accountable."

### Ashley Hinson (IA-02)
Add: "As a Judiciary Committee member who champions transparency, Representative Hinson's support would be valuable."

### Maria Elvira Salazar (FL-27)
Add: "With Representative Salazar's journalism background and Miami's trafficking concerns, her voice would be particularly powerful."

---

## Closing If Positive Response

"Thank you! Will the Representative be signing the discharge petition this week? Can I follow up with your office?"

## Closing If Negative/Noncommittal

"I understand. Please convey to the Representative that constituents are watching this closely. Thank you for your time."
