**Headline:** Congress Has 134 Signatures. Survivors Need 218.

**Deck:** A bipartisan discharge petition can force transparency on Epstein files—with victim protections

---

On September 3, survivors of trafficking stood at the Capitol and delivered a simple message: "This is not a hoax." They weren't conspiracy theorists or political operatives. They were Americans who experienced unspeakable trauma, asking their government for one thing: the truth, delivered safely.

That same day, the House Oversight Committee released approximately 33,000 pages of Epstein-related documents. The headlines celebrated transparency. The reality? Much was already public, and critical portions remained heavily redacted. It was accountability theater, not actual accountability.

But there's a path forward—one that protects survivors while serving the public interest. A discharge petition now circulating in the House would force a vote on a comprehensive disclosure framework modeled on the successful JFK Records Act. It needs 218 signatures. It has 134.

[Or: As a resident of [DISTRICT], I'm calling on Rep. [NAME] to be signature 135.]

The framework is elegantly simple: Presume release, protect victims, ensure oversight. Every government-held Epstein record would be disclosed unless it meets narrow, time-limited exemptions for things like active investigations. An independent board—including a survivor advocate—would review any proposed withholdings. All minors' identities would be automatically redacted, with adult survivors choosing whether to be named. A public index would document exactly what's withheld and why.

This isn't about salacious details or political gotchas. It's about understanding how powerful people enabled horrific crimes for years. It's about validation for survivors who've been dismissed as fantasists. Most importantly, it's about preventing future predators from operating with impunity.

The objections are predictable but addressable. "Ongoing investigations could be compromised"—that's why the framework includes narrow exemptions reviewed by an independent board. "Victims could be exposed"—automatic redaction of identifying information is non-negotiable. "National security concerns"—the JFK model has successfully handled classified materials for decades.

What we can't accept is the status quo: selective leaks, political manipulation, and survivors left wondering if anyone believes them. The piecemeal approach—releasing some documents while keeping others sealed indefinitely—serves no one except those with something to hide.

Four Republicans have already signed: Thomas Massie, Nancy Mace, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Lauren Boebert. If all Democrats sign as expected, we need just two more Republicans to reach 218. Representatives Young Kim (CA-40) and Jen Kiggans (VA-02) have strong records on accountability and represent competitive districts where voters demand transparency. Their signatures could make the difference.

[Or: Rep. [NAME] has [relevant background/position]. Their signature would show real leadership.]

Some will say this is a distraction from "real" issues. Tell that to the survivors who live with trauma daily. Tell that to the parents whose children remain at risk from trafficking networks. Tell that to the citizens who've lost faith in institutions that seem to protect the powerful over the vulnerable.

The framework isn't perfect, but it's principled. It balances the public's right to know with survivors' right to privacy. It replaces arbitrary secrecy with accountable process. Most importantly, it acknowledges a simple truth: sunlight remains the best disinfectant.

Congress has two choices: continue the theater of selective disclosure, or establish a real framework for truth with dignity. The discharge petition is that framework. It deserves 218 signatures. It deserves a vote.

If your representative hasn't signed, call them. If they have, thank them. This isn't about right or left—it's about right and wrong. And 84 signatures away from forcing Congress to choose.
