# Daily Update: October 17, 2025

## Signature Count
**217 / 218** (99.5%)

## Critical Development: Procedural Obstruction

### The Deliberate Delay
**Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva** won her Arizona-07 special election on **September 23, 2025** and immediately pledged to sign the discharge petition as the 218th and final signature needed to force a House vote on Epstein files transparency.

**She has not been sworn in for 24+ days.**

### The Double Standard

Speaker Mike Johnson claims the government shutdown prevents him from swearing in Grijalva. However, recent precedent directly contradicts this:

**April 2025:**
- Rep. Jimmy Patronis (R-FL): Sworn in during pro-forma session **1 day after** special election
- Rep. Randy Fine (R-FL): Sworn in during pro-forma session **1 day after** special election

**September 2025:**
- Rep. James Walkinshaw (D-VA): Sworn in **less than 24 hours** after special election

**October 2025:**
- Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ): **24+ days waiting** with no scheduled swearing-in date

### Legal and Political Response

**Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes** (October 14):
- Threatened legal action to force Grijalva's swearing-in
- Election results have been officially certified
- Arizona's 7th District currently has no congressional representation

**Congressional Response:**
- Democrats accuse Johnson of using shutdown to avoid Epstein vote
- Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) reaffirmed he has 218 votes ready once House returns
- White House reportedly called GOP signatures on petition a "hostile act"

## Current Status Breakdown

### Confirmed Signatures: 216
- **Democrats:** 212 of 214
- **Republicans:** 4 (Massie, Mace, Greene, Boebert)

### Pledged: 1
- **Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ-07)** - Waiting to be sworn in

### Needed: 1
- Would reach 218 threshold immediately upon Grijalva's swearing-in
- Would trigger automatic House floor vote on discharge petition

## What This Means

This is the first time in recent memory that a duly elected representative has been prevented from being sworn in for this length of time during peacetime. The contrast with recent GOP swearing-ins makes the political calculation transparent:

**Leadership knows** that the moment Grijalva is sworn in, the 218th signature triggers a vote that bypasses their control entirely.

## The Stakes

- **For survivors:** Continued delay of the transparency they're begging for
- **For democracy:** Procedural obstruction to prevent a majority vote
- **For precedent:** Erosion of norms around swearing in elected representatives
- **For the petition:** Every day of delay allows pressure on existing signers to mount

## Today's Action Items

1. **Contact Speaker Johnson's office**: 202-225-2777
   - Ask why Grijalva isn't being sworn in when GOP members were sworn in immediately
   - Point to April and September precedents

2. **Contact your own representative**
   - If GOP: Ask them to publicly call for Grijalva's immediate swearing-in
   - If Dem: Ask them to amplify pressure on Johnson

3. **Share the timeline**
   - The 24-day delay vs. 1-day swearing-ins for GOP members tells the story
   - Use #SwearInGrijalva and #EpsteinFilesPetition

4. **Thank the GOP Heroes**
   - Massie, Mace, Greene, Boebert broke ranks for transparency
   - Positive reinforcement makes it easier for others to join

## Media Coverage

- **NPR:** "Adelita Grijalva can force a vote on the Epstein files, but she's still not sworn in"
- **The Hill:** "Republicans refuse to swear in Adelita Grijalva, delaying Jeffrey Epstein petition"
- **Axios:** "Mike Johnson faces bipartisan heat over delayed vote on Epstein files"
- **TIME:** "What to Know About Adelita Grijalva and Her Stalled Swearing-In to Congress"

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priority:** Continue pressure on Speaker Johnson to swear in Grijalva

**Secondary:** Maintain support for existing signers who face leadership pressure

**Long-term:** Document this obstruction as a case study in how leadership can block majority will
